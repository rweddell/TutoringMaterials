term,definition
argument,Another term for parameter. An argument is a value given to a function.
assignment,Associates a variable name with a value.
boolean,A data type which is made up of 1s and 0s. Can also evalute to True/False. Primarily used as a result of a comparison.
call,Action performed when a function is invoked.
cast,Convert a variable to a different data type: str() int() float().
class,Definition of a data type. Can be custom-built to create complex data types.
concatenation,Adding two series variables by appending the second value to the end of the first value.
dictionary,Data structure made up by a series of key/value pairs. The keys and values can be of any data type. Also called an 'associative array'.
elif,Comparison statement used to handle a second specific condition after an if-statement evaluates to False.
else,Comparison statement used to handle all other conditions after an if-statement evaluates to False.
except,Key word used to begin a code block which handles Exceptions that are the result of a 'try' block.
Exception,Output value of an expression if an error occurs during execution.
float,Numerical data type to represent non-whole numbers. 
for,Type of loop used to iterate over a sequence or a given numeric range.
from,Keyword used to import a specified subsection of a library
function,Partitioned piece of code that can be referenced or 'called'.
global,Scope from which anything can be referenced. When using 'global' keyword with in a local scope indicates to the interpreter that the variable value is found at the global scope.
if,Key word used to start a comparison block. Evaluates to True or False.
import,Key word used to reference a downloaded library.
index,A specific location in a data structure such as a list or string.
integer,Numeric data type used to represent whole numbers.
library,A package of code that can be downloaded into a development environment. Contains classes and functions that can be referenced.
list,Data type in the form of a series of values separated by commas. Implemented using square brackets [].
local,Scope defined within a specified space. Variables created within a local scope can only be referenced from within that scope.
loop,Code block that continually executes until a specified condition is met.
operator,Symbol used to execute a statement. Ex: + - > < = ==
parameter,Input or output variables from a function.
return,Key word used to send the output of a function to an output variable.
scope,Existence-space of a variable. Can be local or global.
set,Collection data type that is a unordered sequence of values. Only one instance of each value is allowed in a set. Implemented with parentheses ().
slice,Sub-section of a sequence variable (list string)
string,Ordered, non-numerical sequence of characters.
try,Key word used to begin a code block that partitions code to handle errors in order to avoid a program crash.
variable,Name used to refer to a given value of a data type.
while,Type of loop. Used when the number of required iterations is unknown.
with,Used to handle exceptions. Frequently used when opening files.
yield,Similar in behavior to the 'return' keyword but if iterating over a sequence variable will reference the next space used in the last iteration. Frequently used in conjunction with loops.
