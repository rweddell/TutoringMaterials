- The function should take no arguments
- The function should ask the user for a number
- Print the result to screen
'''





'''
Exercise 5:
- Write a function that will take two arguments: an integer called num, and a list of integers called numbers
- The function checks that if num is in numbers
- If num is in numbers, return True.
- Otherwise return False
'''





'''
Exercise 6:
- Write a function called is_vowel that takes one argument: a string called char
- If char has a length greater than 1, return False
- If char is a vowel, return True
- Otherwise return False
'''
char1 = 'a'
char2 = 'b'




'''
Exercise 7:
- Write a function called count_vowels that takes one argument: a string called phrase
- Count the number of vowels in phrase and return the count
'''
phrase1 = 'countthenumberofvowelsinthisphrase'
phrase2 = 'thnmskdlwpz'



'''
Exercise 8:
- Write a function that takes one argument: a list of integers called numbers 
- The function determines if all of the items are unique
- If all of the items are unique, return 0
- Else, return a list of the non-unique numbers
'''
numbers1 = [23, 65, 12, 34, 2, 5, 7]
numbers2 = [23, 65, 12, 34, 2, 5, 7, 12, 23]



'''
Exercise 9:
- Write a function that takes one argument called: a string called text
- The function creates a dictionary of the unique words and counts the number of occurances of each word
- Return the dictionary
'''
text1 = 'twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky when the blazing sun is gone when he nothing shines upon then you show your little light twinkle twinkle all the night then the traveller in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark he could not see which way to go if you did not twinkle so in the dark blue sky you keep and often through my curtains peep for you never shut your eye till the sun is in the sky as your bright and tiny spark lights the traveller in the dark though i know not what you are twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are'
